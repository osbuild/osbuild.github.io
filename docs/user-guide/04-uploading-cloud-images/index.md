# Uploading cloud images

`osbuild-composer` can upload images to a cloud provider right after they are built. The configuration is slightly different for each cloud provider. See individual subsections of this documentation.

The following targets are supported:

- [AWS](uploading-cloud-images/uploading-to-aws)
- [AWS S3](uploading-cloud-images/uploading-to-aws-s3)
- [Azure](uploading-cloud-images/uploading-to-azure)
- [GCP](uploading-cloud-images/uploading-to-gcp)
- [Oracle Cloud](uploading-cloud-images/uploading-to-oci)
- [Generic S3](uploading-cloud-images/uploading-to-generic-s3)
