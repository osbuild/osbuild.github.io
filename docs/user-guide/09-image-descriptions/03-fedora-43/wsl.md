Image description for **wsl** on **Fedora 43**.

The descriptions below describe the base image version, that can be further customized by the user using the [Blueprint customizations](../../01-blueprint-reference.md).

:::note[Package sets]

Each image description contains a list of base packages that make up the image. This list is dependency-resolved using the distribution's package manager and subsequently installed into the image. This means that the list of actually installed packages depends on the available RPM repositories and the dependencies of the packages listed in the image's base package set.

:::warning[Do not rely on the image description format]

The format of the image description is not guaranteed to be stable. It is published for informational purposes only.
