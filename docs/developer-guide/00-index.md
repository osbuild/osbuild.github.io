# Developer Guide

Welcome to the Image Builder team developer guides. This section of our documentation contains information about the [various projects](./projects) that our team works on aimed at developers of manifests, omnifests, distributions, or source code.

A birds eye view of our projects and what they do is written down in [Projects](./projects). How the projects relate to each other and where they live in the service is documented under [Stack](./stack)
