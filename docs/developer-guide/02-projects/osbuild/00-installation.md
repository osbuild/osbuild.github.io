# Installation

`osbuild` is a Python project, however it is not shipped as a normal Python project. It is best to install `osbuild` from your distribution package manager instead of running it from source.

## Fedora/CentOS/RHEL

```
€ dnf install osbuild
```

## Arch Linux

```
€ pacman -S osbuild
```
