**Apply post-copy updates to an ostree repo/deployment**

The way osbuild works the ostree deployment is built in a chroot and
stored as a regular directory of files before finally being copied to
the physical filesystem. This means that for example, ostree fs-verity
support doesn't work, as the fs-verity setting of files is not copied.
To support fs-verity in generated images you have to run this stage
after copying the final ostree tree onto the target filesystem.
Notes:
 - Ensure the target filesystem supports fs-verity. See e.g. the
   `verity` option in org.osbuild.mkfs.ext4.
 - Requires ostree version 2023.8 or later in the buildroot.
