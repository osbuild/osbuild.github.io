**Fix paths in /boot/loader/entries**

Fixes paths in /boot/loader/entries that have incorrect paths for /boot.
This happens because some boot loader config tools (e.g. grub2-mkrelpath)
examine /proc/self/mountinfo to find the "real" path to /boot, and find the
path to the osbuild tree - which won't be valid at boot time for this image.
The paths in the Bootloader Specification are relative to the partition
they are located on, i.e. `/boot/loader/...` if `/boot` is on the root
file-system partition. If `/boot` is on a separate partition, the correct
path would be `/loader/.../` The `prefix` can be used to adjust for that.
By default it is `/boot`, i.e. assumes `/boot` is on the root file-system.
This stage reads and (re)writes all .conf files in /boot/loader/entries.

## Schema 1

```json
{
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "prefix": {
      "description": "Prefix to use, normally `/boot`",
      "type": "string",
      "default": "/boot"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema 2

```json
{}
```
