**Generates .hmac checksum files**

Generates HMAC values for given files and stores them alongside the original
for later verification.
The stage uses the \<algorithm\>hmac commands (e.g. sha512hmac) which use a
built-in key when none is provided. Future extensions of this stage may
add a key parameter if and when it becomes a requirement. 
In its current state, the stage can be used to replicate the generation of
kernel hmac files \[1\] which are used for integrity verification when booting
in FIPS mode.
Notes:
  - Requires hmac calc in the build root (libkcapi-hmaccalc)
