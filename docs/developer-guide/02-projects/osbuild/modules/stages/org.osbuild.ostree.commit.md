**Assemble a file system tree into a ostree commit**

Needs a file system tree that is already conforming to the ostree
system layout\[1\], specified via the `tree` input and commits it
to a repository. The repository must have been created at `/repo`.
Additional metadata is stored in `/compose.json` which contains
the commit compose information. This is also returned via the
metadata API to osbuild.
