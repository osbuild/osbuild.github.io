The `image-builder` project provides image building with [user customizations](./01-usage.md#blueprints) for a variety of predefined operating systems like Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL.

For any questions you can take a look at our [FAQ](./10-faq.md) or the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/osbuild/image-builder-cli) and [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/osbuild/discussions). We're also available in the [#image-builder:fedoraproject.org](https://matrix.to/#/#image-builder:fedoraproject.org?web-instance%5Belement.io%5D=chat.fedoraproject.org) Matrix channel.
